# SSRF2gopher
Gopher protocol is used a lot when exploiting SSRF. This script generates a gopher payload that can be used to replicate an HTTP request.
A Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability occurs when an attacker manipulates a server-side application into making HTTP requests to a domain of their choice, even internal applications can be a target.
